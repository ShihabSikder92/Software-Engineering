# Week-1  
## Introduction of Software
### Software
**Software** is a collection of programs, data, and related documentation that tells a computer what to do and how to do it.
#### 🔹 Types of Software:
- **System Software** – Operating systems, device drivers.
- **Application Software** – Word processors, spreadsheets.
- **Embedded Software** – Software built into devices.
- **Web-based Software** – Applications running over the web.
- **AI/ML Software** – Intelligent systems for automation and decision making.
#### 🔹 Importance:
- Automates complex tasks
- Enhances business and daily life
- Drives innovation in nearly all industries
## The Evolving role of software
Software has moved from supporting tasks to **driving innovation** across all domains:

### ⏳ Evolution:
- **Past**: Basic computation, academic/scientific usage
- **Present**: E-commerce, communication, banking, transportation, education
- **Future**: AI, robotics, smart cities, personalized healthcare
## Characteristics of software
1. **Intangible** – Cannot be physically touched
2. **Developed, not manufactured** – Created through engineering processes
3. **Customizable** – Tailored for specific users or industries
4. **Evolves over time** – Needs constant maintenance and upgrades
5. **Error-prone** – Complex logic leads to bugs
6. **High initial development cost** – Requires skilled manpower
## The Changing Nature Of Software
- **Product → Service** (e.g., SaaS – Software as a Service)
- **Monolithic → Distributed/Cloud-native systems**
- **PC-based → Mobile-first and web-based**
- **Standalone → Integrated ecosystems**
- **Offline → Always connected**

Modern software must be:
- Reliable
- Scalable
- Secure
- Maintainable
## Legacy Software
**Legacy software** refers to old systems that are still critical but outdated in design and technology.

### ⚠️ Challenges:
- Difficult to maintain
- Poor documentation
- Not compatible with modern systems
- Prone to failure

### 💡 Why They're Still Used:
- High cost of replacement
- Business-critical functions
- Familiarity by users

### ✅ Solutions:
- **Reengineering**
- **Migration**
- **Encapsulation with APIs**
## Software Engineering

**Software Engineering** is a disciplined, engineering-based approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.

### 🎯 Objectives:
- Build high-quality software
- On time and within budget
- That meets customer needs

### 🔁 Phases of Software Development:
1. Requirements Analysis
2. System Design
3. Implementation (Coding)
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

## A Layered Technology


Software Engineering can be viewed as a **layered technology**:
```text
+--------------------+
|      Tools         |  ← e.g., IDEs, Test tools
+--------------------+
|     Methods        |  ← Technical approaches (e.g., OO design, testing)
+--------------------+
|     Process        |  ← Framework to build software (e.g., Agile, Waterfall)
+--------------------+
|  Quality Focus     |  ← Ensures standards and practices are followed
+--------------------+
